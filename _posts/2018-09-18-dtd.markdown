textshort: Photographs of sewer systems and passageways from 1925 to 1949 offer a
  rare look at the underbelly of Chicago.
textlong: The sewer systems and passageways that lie beneath our feet are critical
  to the health and well being of the city. Offering a rare look at the “underbelly”
  of Chicago, this collection of historical images features construction photographs
  of sewers and tunnels.
textrich: <p>In 1855, Boston engineer Ellis S. Chesbrough was invited to Chicago to
  design the first comprehensive system of underground sewers in the United States.
  His work lifted the city to make room for the new sewers which became the most extensive
  in the world. In the more than 150 years since Chicago&rsquo;s Department of Water
  Management continues to service and maintain this underground system.  </p><p>Take
  a look at these wonders in images from the 1920s-1960s as you start  <a href="http://cdm16818.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/search/collection/dtd/searchterm/Above+ground/field/contri/mode/all/conn/and/order/nosort">above
